# CVU-Module-1

Hi! My name is Shaun Joseph. I am an undergraduate that is working on a second degree (being natural resource environmental science with a focus on ecohydrology), and am currently a junior. I work in an ecohydrology lab, and have been to a few workshops for coding such as hackweek, surface water school in Oregon, and intend on attending the snow workshop with CUAHSI in January.
My goals for this module is as follows:
1. Learn how to produce code/understand it better. When I went Hackwee, I learned how to use code from the other grad students, but didn't truly understand certain things about it, but learned about some aspects through stackstac.
2. Further develop more skills in learning how to utilize Jupyterlab/notebook for future projects and possibly my first paper before I apply for grad school at U of A in 2024.
3. Learn how to use this module for my poster I wanted to create for diel streamflow cycles and create nice graphs/photos for the poster.
4. Begin to learn how to utilize github since it is vital amongst different scientists within the community.
